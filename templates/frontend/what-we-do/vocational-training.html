                    In 2024, the Africa Oasis Foundation launched the Farming Outreach program to continuously improve our initiatives and help the families we serve become more self-reliant. This program was established in response to the observed need to support parents and guardians of children in our Scholarship Program, equipping them to better care for their families. Since our Education Scholarship Outreach operates in a rural area, most of our families are subsistence farmers.

                    The Farming Outreach program introduces "Farming God’s Way," a resource designed to address the challenges our families face. This approach tackles both the spiritual and practical aspects of poverty. By integrating biblical principles, it provides sustainable and profitable farming methods.

                    Farming God’s Way" is not an organization, but a comprehensive teaching resource. It promotes improved and sustainable conservation agriculture techniques to local farmers. These methods help enhance crop yields, preserve soil health, and ensure long-term agricultural productivity. Through this program, we aim to empower farmers with the knowledge and skills they need to thrive, thereby fostering self-reliance and improved living conditions for their families.

                    Despite ideal conditions for farming, many Rwandan families face food insecurity due to poor farming practices, soil erosion, and lack of motivation. Addressing these issues through improved agricultural techniques, education, and support is essential to help families fully utilize their environment's natural advantages.

While "Farming God’s Way" will help increase crop yields, we also want to ensure farmers receive fair compensation for their efforts.

The warehouse provides much-needed storage space, enabling farmers to store their crops safely and sell them when market prices are more favorable. This reduces their vulnerability to market fluctuations and helps them avoid the financial strain of selling at low prices during harvest time.

Our families feel a sense of pride and accomplishment in their work, knowing that their efforts are valued and that their crops are helping to feed their community. Through these efforts, we aim to create a more sustainable and prosperous future for subsistence farmers in Rwanda.
