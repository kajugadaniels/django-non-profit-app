                    We will soon open a clinic in Kamabuye that will provide necessary medical care for students in our Scholarship Program. This clinic will offer a range of healthcare services to ensure our students stay healthy and receive prompt treatment when needed.

                If our clinic in Kamabuye cannot meet a student's medical needs, we will refer them to specialized hospitals in Nyamata and Kigali. These hospitals are equipped to handle more complex medical issues and provide advanced care. Our referral process will ensure that students receive the best possible treatment and support, whether at our clinic or at a partner hospital. This system aims to guarantee comprehensive healthcare for all students in our program, enhancing their overall well-being and ability to succeed in their studies.

                                    Our favorite aspect of our Medical Care Outreach is the opportunity to offer comfort, love, and hope to people in need. Being present during their difficult times allows us to provide emotional and medical support. When we share in their struggles, offering care and empathy, we build valuable relationships with the individuals we serve.

                                    This support goes beyond medical treatment. By being there to listen, offer a comforting word, or provide a shoulder to cry on, we establish a deep connection with our patients. This connection fosters trust, making them feel valued and understood. Over time, this trust strengthens, forming a solid foundation for ongoing support and care.
