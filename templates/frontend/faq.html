To ensure that our children's experience remains uninterrupted, we kindly request that you provide us with a 60-day advance notice. This allows us ample time to find a new sponsor for your child.

Nonetheless, we advise against initiating personal communication with the students' parents, out of respect for cultural sensitivities and to maintain equitable treatment among all families participating in our program. Should you decide to visit the Africa Oasis Foundation and meet your sponsored child, we can facilitate a home visit for you.

                                                    There is also a provision for the purchase of gifts for students who have not yet been sponsored. As we strive to ensure equal educational experiences for all our children, we advise against sending extra presents to our students.

                                                    As a benefactor of the Africa Oasis Foundation, you have the opportunity to send words of support and motivation to your sponsored child up to three times annually. Our students eagerly anticipate these heartfelt messages from their sponsors. The knowledge that someone across the globe cares for them and believes in their potential greatly influences their achievements.

                                                    Through our dedicated sponsor portal, you can compose and send letters filled with affection and inspiration to your child. They will receive and read your letters at school and respond in kind. Our team in the US will collect these replies and ensure they are sent to you. We organize a letter-writing event each term, providing you with the chance to correspond with your child up to three times a year. Additionally, we will keep you updated on their accomplishments and notable happenings at the school.

                                                    Indeed, they are committed! We hold the conviction that parents who are actively engaged and contribute to their childâ€™s educational journey tend to be more invested in their long-term academic and personal success. This commitment from our parents is evident as they either contribute towards their child's tuition or engage in our Earning and Learning Program to assist in meeting these expenses.

                                                    The investment from most families is substantial, yet they recognize the value and long-term benefits associated with the high-quality education provided by the Africa Oasis Foundation. Additionally, parents are encouraged to be a part of worship assemblies, engage in parental meetings, and acquire vocational skills, further fostering a supportive community environment.

                                                    Africa Oasis Foundation does not operate an orphanage. Instead, our mission centers
                                                    on supporting families to avert the risk of children ending up as orphans. Many times,
                                                    due to an inability to meet their basic needs, parents or guardians feel compelled to
                                                    place their children in orphanages. Through your partnership, the significant
                                                    responsibilities of covering education fees, providing daily meals, and ensuring medical
                                                    care are lifted from the shoulders of parents and guardians. This support helps keep
                                                    families together.
