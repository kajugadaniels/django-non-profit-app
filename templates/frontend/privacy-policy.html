                <p>
                    The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies: Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;
                </p>
                <p>
                    processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject; processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;
                </p>
                <p>
                    processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.

                    Unless specified otherwise in this document, Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for and may be retained for longer due to applicable legal obligation or based on the Users’ consent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore:

                <p>
                    Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the Owner and the User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate interests shall be retained as long as needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of this document or by contacting the Owner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right of access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.
